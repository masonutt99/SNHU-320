## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure my code is functional by assessing all the labeled requirements and creating passing and failing standards for those.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try to think like a user at first and think of how I could possible enter my information. Then I try to break everything like its a game to do stuff I am not supposed to be allowed to do.

## How do I approach designing software?

I love designing software to solve a problem. This increases my motivation so I try to first assess what the problem is before creating the solution.
